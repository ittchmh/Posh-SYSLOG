Function Get-NetworkAdapter
{
    <#
        .SYNOPSIS
        Gets the correstponding network adapter for the specified local IP address.
        
        .DESCRIPTION
        Internal Function.

        This replaces the Get-NetAdapter call in previous versions, for all intents and purposes this is a decent subsititue.
        The reason why we want to perform this replacement is so that we don't have the dependency on the Get-NetAdapter and NetTCPIP module,
        as they are not available to PowerShell 6 Core.

        .OUTPUTS
        System.Net.NetworkInformation.SystemUnicastIPAddressInformation that has informaiton on the network card (actually the address assignment).
